# final-project-unsupervised-Mathew

This is my unsupervised learning project on a set of pokemon card entires in various tournaments across the years 2011-2023. 

The data of the original is held in the tournaments.csv

You have to run the MathewPokemonUnsupervised notebook to generate all the relevant code and visuals that will be used. It will also spit out a cleaned data set
